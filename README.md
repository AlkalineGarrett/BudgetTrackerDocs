# Alkaline.Org Transaction Downloader

Alkaline.Org Transaction Downloader is a workflow run from Google Colab to download transactions from a financial institution and append them to a Google Sheet.

* **Why not Tiller?**: Tiller refuses to support pending transactions. The present downloader supports both posted and pending transactions.

This repository includes public documentation about the transaction downloader.
